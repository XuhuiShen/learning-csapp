00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,770
Khan are we good all right so greetings

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,130
and welcome everybody to this first

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:19,830
exciting edition of 15 18 to 13 or 15

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:23,619
5:13 why are you laughing at me so what

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:29,070
to say here we are and the other end of

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:30,250
the camera there you are hope we're all

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,359
happy to be Robin you know I'm happy to

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,779
be here

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,098
this is one of my favorite classes to

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:37,000
teach I mean this class has a lot of all

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,440
sorts of different things that are

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,820
really really really useful right it's

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,160
like a candy box of useful stuff because

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,649
it's samples right important things from

16
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,570
all of our systems systems classes right

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,250
to get you sort of ready and exposed to

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,770
material while teaching some really

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,280
critically important hi some really

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,520
critically important system skills okay

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,070
so really is an important class and I

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:10,470
love teaching it because it's it's so

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:12,319
applied and so much fun okay um what to

24
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,720
say the course theme you know if you're

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,369
an undergraduate student or ever were an

26
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,720
undergraduate student in computer

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,170
science you may remember that at the

28
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,360
beginning of your education we talked a

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,830
lot about abstraction okay we worked a

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,590
lot with abstractions this idea that if

31
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,229
you have really complex systems what you

32
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,959
want to do is encapsulate certain

33
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,060
functionality make it into black boxes

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,159
and ignore it that if you're trying to

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,509
understand something really really

36
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,099
really really really complex

37
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:46,380
you can't possibly grok all the details

38
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,200
at once so you assemble meaningful

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,049
bullet building blocks whether they're

40
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:56,560
actual real tangible building blocks

41
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:58,130
like building a building out of concrete

42
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,619
blocks as opposed to you know as opposed

43
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,040
to concrete or right code-wise building

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,828
blocks like modules and libraries or

45
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:12,500
intellectual building blocks like Big O

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,479
and amortized analysis right and so we

47
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,900
focus a lot on

48
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,610
you're acting things to get powerful

49
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,590
things you know represented in a way in

50
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,389
which we can use it and this is a great

51
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,579
tool that's important to every aspect of

52
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:26,908
computer science apply the theoretical

53
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:28,318
okay and it's one that's used from

54
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,150
freshman year all the way through

55
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,699
graduate education and you know careers

56
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:36,539
in the computer sciences but sometimes

57
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:38,430
in narrow areas you actually need to

58
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,829
blow through those abstractions you

59
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:44,090
actually need to get down to the details

60
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,560
with it's measuring actual performance

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,269
and actual time rather than throwing

62
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:52,139
away that pesky constant right we're

63
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:55,000
thinking about how something runs or is

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,690
running on a real computer and that's

65
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:02,030
for two thirteen is about two thirteen

66
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:05,139
is about doing it for real okay

67
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:09,739
why well a to become effective

68
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:12,098
programmers right and be to be effective

69
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:13,340
students right we do it because it's a

70
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,720
critically important skill to the

71
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,019
practical programmer we also do it B's

72
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,549
is a critically important skill to

73
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:22,109
learning more advanced computer science

74
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:26,568
most especially in systems but also in a

75
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:31,650
ton of other areas right graphics

76
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:33,810
databases all sorts of things okay we've

77
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,220
got though a bunch of slides here about

78
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,169
these great realities I don't spend a

79
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:38,340
whole bunch of time on these great

80
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,109
realities right now because we spend the

81
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:42,720
whole semester diving into the details

82
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,190
but perhaps they're a good example of

83
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,039
abstraction in real-world detail when

84
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:52,840
you were in math classes you learned

85
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,150
about integers right the set of all

86
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,949
integers and integers were really cool

87
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:58,269
right because they were a countably

88
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:59,239
infinite of them no matter what energy

89
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,739
you give me I can give you something

90
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,989
bigger and no matter what energy you

91
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:11,709
give me I can give you something smaller

92
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:14,560
right amazing and there's space between

93
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,639
them you can't get there

94
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,079
but computers don't quite work that way

95
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,360
right computers have a finite amount of

96
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,430
memory they don't have an infinite

97
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,870
amount of memory they have a finite

98
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,740
amount of memory

99
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,560
yeah much how big is much is J much I

100
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,180
don't know how much memory do you have

101
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,459
in that computer but once we start

102
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:37,050
dealing with real world and real world

103
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,779
limits finite memory that means we need

104
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:43,130
to have a finite representation of a

105
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,300
number right if I only have a much

106
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,130
memory the bin the you know in one case

107
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,130
I can use it all for a single number

108
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,630
that's probably not really useful right

109
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,399
I probably want to partition it so I

110
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,630
could have more than one thing in memory

111
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:58,880
and say well my memories yay big my

112
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,360
integers that most can be a big and now

113
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,089
we start to have real limits

114
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:06,310
maybe an integer can only go from let's

115
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,459
say negative 32,000 or so to positive 32

116
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:12,940
thousand or so now so now we're talking

117
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,519
about a difference between intz right

118
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:16,740
the integer representation we have

119
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:21,569
available in programming are you

120
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:27,610
recording class yes no we provide the

121
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:29,940
only recording turn that off so go ahead

122
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,440
and interject right now there is a

123
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,089
policy against electronically mediated

124
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:38,209
communication and recording okay so

125
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:44,110
you're not allowed to I am text email

126
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:44,899
web surf join chat rooms IRC

127
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:49,160
collaboratively edit documents blah blah

128
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,029
blah blah blah

129
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:52,800
no electronically mediated communication

130
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,889
so you can use your laptop to take notes

131
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:56,060
you can use your laptop to look at

132
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,848
slides if you downloaded them in advance

133
00:05:56,848 --> 00:06:01,319
okay but no electronically mediated

134
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:02,209
communication secondly the only

135
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:06,918
recording of this class is the one that

136
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:07,069
we take you will have access it to it to

137
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:11,750
this semester in this semester only and

138
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:14,288
then it goes away ok and the reason for

139
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:16,319
that is very obvious you guys are

140
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,779
enrolled students you're taking 15 to 13

141
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:22,269
or 15 5/13 and quite honestly you're

142
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:27,598
paying us for it we're not delivering

143
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:29,699
these videos for free ok 15 to 13 has a

144
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,529
canonical set of lectures it has a

145
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:32,870
canonical set of labs

146
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,540
that's the canonical set of auto graders

147
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:38,100
these days it has an inker ever growing

148
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,579
set of exam questions and you know exam

149
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:43,949
graders no one out there is gonna take

150
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:44,019
our set of materials and distribute them

151
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:47,310
and call it a Carnegie Mellon equivalent

152
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:50,399
program it's not right because doesn't

153
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,399
have you as a collection of students it

154
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,930
doesn't have our course staff as a

155
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,870
collection of people supporting it right

156
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,680
and we're just not going in that

157
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,199
direction so for this semester you'll

158
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,168
have access to all the video once you're

159
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:05,319
done the video goes away if you want to

160
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,790
refer to things after that you've got

161
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:13,769
your notes and you've got the book and

162
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:19,110
you've got the slides but there's no

163
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:20,529
recording okay we good all right and no

164
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:22,459
electronically mediated communication

165
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:26,680
here so if you want to have fun it's got

166
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,009
to be you know my type of fun all right

167
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:35,819
back to this so once we have finite

168
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:37,639
memory right what to say now we can't

169
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,769
have infinite number of integers right

170
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:41,149
we have relatively few number of

171
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:43,910
integers so what happens if we have the

172
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,769
biggest int that we can represent and we

173
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:50,649
add one to it it's not going to get

174
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:53,940
bigger right different answers to that

175
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:57,519
question are possible maybe it goes into

176
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,269
an error state flags that is a number

177
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,550
that's too high

178
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,750
that happens with floating point numbers

179
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,449
actually with integers as you pointed

180
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,160
out it wraps around and becomes the most

181
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,490
negative number and we'll talk about why

182
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,639
okay

183
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,649
but this is a classic example of why

184
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:15,168
sometimes you've got to be able to look

185
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:18,269
through abstraction into the detail

186
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:21,598
because intz right look a lot like

187
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,000
integers work a lot like integers for a

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,228
lot of problems there are great

189
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:25,690
substitute for integers and then

190
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,949
suddenly things don't work the way you

191
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:31,899
think they should and when they don't

192
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:33,529
work the way you think they should now

193
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:36,149
you've got to actually understand why

194
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:38,179
how they're implemented right why it's

195
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:42,038
implemented that way and how you can

196
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,198
make things work that way okay

197
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:48,000
another issue right and it's less of an

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,990
issue most of the time and then

199
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,389
sometimes it matters right there's no

200
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:56,129
such thing as randomness when it comes

201
00:08:53,129 --> 00:09:03,279
to a computer okay at best we have some

202
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:04,328
approximation of randomness right what

203
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:06,889
happens right there's something called a

204
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:08,419
pseudo-random number generator

205
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:10,490
it's a function where the values bounce

206
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,110
around in a way that you really wouldn't

207
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:16,938
predict unless you were using the same

208
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:20,350
function and then we pick some starting

209
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:22,009
point along this it's called the seed

210
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:25,860
and now we get a sequence of seemingly

211
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,500
random numbers so unless you know the

212
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,360
generator and you know the seed it looks

213
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,779
like a random set of numbers okay and

214
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:35,509
then how do we pick that seed well what

215
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:38,429
we try to do is get things from outside

216
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:41,730
the computer then approximate random

217
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,698
things because outside the computer

218
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:46,679
there are random numbers or randomness

219
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,078
at least and so we try to use things

220
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:49,880
like the measure of time between ports

221
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,919
coming to the between Bo packets showing

222
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,438
up at the network or you know the value

223
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:56,779
and time between keystrokes and and and

224
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,818
and and take a whole bunch of system

225
00:09:56,818 --> 00:10:01,409
events coming from different sources

226
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:02,198
that don't have the same force function

227
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:05,909
and hopefully have no discernable force

228
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:07,519
function and use those to generate a

229
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,860
sequence of numbers that we can then use

230
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,880
to seed our random number generator why

231
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,438
not just use these random things because

232
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:16,028
aren't enough of them if we need a whole

233
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:19,708
bunch of random numbers we can't collect

234
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:23,799
enough randomness there's no infinite

235
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:27,188
improbability generator here okay so we

236
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:29,179
use external events that are hopefully a

237
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:32,909
random or approximately random tusu to

238
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:35,750
de-seed pseudo-random number generators

239
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,068
sometimes it matters sometimes doesn't a

240
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:38,110
lot of times a random number generator

241
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,639
number of pseudo-random number generator

242
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,269
is just as good as real random numbers

243
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:45,220
sometimes it's better if something

244
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,899
random is a provider's input to your

245
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,509
program and then your program dies you

246
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:53,948
may have no way of figuring out what

247
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:55,929
that was it was some random event right

248
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:56,828
but if we're actually using a

249
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:58,429
pseudo-random

250
00:10:56,429 --> 00:11:01,019
number generator we could provide the

251
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:04,309
same seed and get the same set of events

252
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:06,320
much better free debugging right to have

253
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,179
pseudo randomness than real randomness

254
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:19,580
of course that predictability isn't good

255
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:23,919
then different story right okay um so

256
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:26,899
back in the day well before my day

257
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:29,269
people used to actually write

258
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:31,089
significant volumes of assembly by hand

259
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:33,440
right when you look at an assembly file

260
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,269
the extension on an assembly file is dot

261
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:42,070
s right dot C for C dot J for Java right

262
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,028
why is assembly dot s and not dot a well

263
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:47,860
the answer is because back in the day it

264
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:50,789
was the source code s source people

265
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:54,610
wrote assembly by hand and then fed it

266
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:58,419
to an assembler okay to get the machine

267
00:11:54,419 --> 00:12:01,679
code and for a long time even after

268
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,139
compilers became a thing right a lot of

269
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:04,549
code was still written in assembly

270
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:07,500
because quite simply compilers weren't

271
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,769
good enough they could generate code you

272
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:12,059
know assembly code from high-level code

273
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:15,958
but couldn't do it really really

274
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,750
efficiently they couldn't do it really

275
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,639
really efficiently for two reasons Hey

276
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,830
the science of writing compilers just

277
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:28,820
hadn't advanced as much and B computers

278
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:30,589
weren't fast enough okay compilers now

279
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:32,269
build a lot of data structures and

280
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:35,339
analyze a lot of different possibilities

281
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,399
to determine the optimal ones when

282
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,990
computers were really slow it wasn't

283
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,730
worth it

284
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:43,809
no one wondered wait a week for a

285
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:46,759
compile okay

286
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,350
but these days computers are much faster

287
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,240
the science of writing compilers is much

288
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,059
better we can write really really

289
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:55,149
efficient compilers and beyond that

290
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:57,799
processors have gotten so complicated

291
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,929
that humans trying to understand how to

292
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:02,820
code for them efficiently suffer from

293
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,610
state explosion we just can't keep all

294
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:09,649
of the possibilities all of those states

295
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:10,240
in their head so humans can't possibly

296
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,049
write

297
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:15,208
code as efficiently in assembly as

298
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:17,480
compilers can there are certain small

299
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,399
bits of assembly that humans still write

300
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,708
by hand okay

301
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:24,440
very small bits usually in the depth of

302
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,769
an operating system or embedded system

303
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:32,200
but other than that all code starts out

304
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,549
as a high-level code now that doesn't

305
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:35,720
mean the programmers don't need to be

306
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,720
able to read assembly in fact we do

307
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,919
because the assembly what's at is what's

308
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,950
actually executing sometimes it's good

309
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,299
enough to look at the high-level code

310
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:47,070
and assume the assembly does the same

311
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:49,940
thing but sometimes the details actually

312
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,799
matter and then we need be able to blow

313
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:55,958
through that abstraction and read the

314
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:57,409
assembly to understand what the Machine

315
00:13:55,409 --> 00:14:04,419
is actually going to do when it's

316
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:07,799
executing our program okay so you know

317
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,500
in a traditional engineering class when

318
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,328
one learned assembly one actually

319
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:13,028
learned assembly by writing it writing a

320
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:16,649
bunch of assembly language programs we

321
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,139
don't do that here because it's not

322
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,389
useful no one writes a bunch of assembly

323
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:22,950
language programs even those people who

324
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,019
code in assembly don't write programs

325
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:27,339
that could be written in high-level code

326
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:29,630
in assembly that's not useful what we're

327
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,909
gonna learn here to do is read assembly

328
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:34,970
and understand assembly and understand

329
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,589
what the assembly is asking the machine

330
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:39,139
to do and understand how that assembly

331
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:41,570
relates to our C code that way we can

332
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,429
program and see and understand what

333
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:46,009
we're asking the machine to do for real

334
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:48,529
when we need to when we care and we can

335
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:50,480
double check our abstract understanding

336
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,759
with a detailed understanding whenever

337
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:57,230
we choose to by diving deep for

338
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:00,839
applications like you know tuning

339
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,539
performance writing the you know the the

340
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:04,850
the really detailed bits and hardware

341
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,620
dependent bits of operating systems and

342
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,500
embedded systems things like fighting

343
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,230
malware and viruses and in very very

344
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,448
very rare cases dealing with program

345
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:17,000
bugs but those are pretty rare cases

346
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,220
most of the time the bugs we write in

347
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,470
our high-level code or our bugs and are

348
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,580
very visible in the high-level code

349
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:29,559
matters right in lower level courses

350
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,820
when you talk about performance and you

351
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,679
talk about algorithms you don't worry a

352
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,529
lot about how big things are right in

353
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:40,419
fact the model for amortized analysis

354
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:46,380
right is for N greater than and not

355
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:49,500
right for some problem really large that

356
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,080
analysis is very useful compellingly

357
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,820
important in many cases but in many

358
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,139
cases the question we're trying to

359
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,269
answer isn't how can I solve this

360
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:58,399
problem with the infinite resources for

361
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,799
the largest possible case it's how can I

362
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:04,690
solve the problem I need to solve which

363
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:12,740
is maybe a big with a set of resources

364
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:14,029
that may be exactly big enough so we

365
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:16,009
actually need to manage memory think

366
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:19,500
about it and you know one doesn't want

367
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:23,950
to have a rich banker right if your

368
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,149
banker is rich what does that mean

369
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:33,649
you're not right whose money is the

370
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:34,269
banker spending yours right well we

371
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:36,950
don't want a rich memory manager we

372
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:41,330
don't want a memory manager that's using

373
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:43,820
all of our memory doing right you don't

374
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:47,620
want a slow memory management want using

375
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:49,070
all of our time so we're gonna look at

376
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,529
how we can manage memory that's in it in

377
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:53,090
a way that's efficient both in terms of

378
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,809
space and time

379
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:59,700
you guys are programmed and see enough

380
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,700
to run into pointer problems out of

381
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:05,940
balance problems freeing things that

382
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:08,099
shouldn't be free problems at the end of

383
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:12,190
the day right the bugs that exist turn

384
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:14,930
out to be very painful and people pretty

385
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,640
lequip to find them because we're

386
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,140
thinking about the problem we're trying

387
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,150
to solve we're thinking about the

388
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,619
process we need to go through to solve

389
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,750
that problem we're thinking about the

390
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,369
resources we need to use to solve that

391
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:28,250
problem we're not necessarily thinking

392
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:32,619
at every juncture about the details of

393
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:36,849
addresses pointers sizes what starts at

394
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:36,950
zero and what starts at 1

395
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:42,400
and so those bugs can be painful memory

396
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,799
performance isn't uniform in many of our

397
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,509
classes we just say look it's in memory

398
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:50,150
memory is fast or it's in disk and disk

399
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,509
is slow but as it turns out there's a

400
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:53,250
whole memory hierarchy there are

401
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,599
registers that operate at the speed of

402
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,380
the processor

403
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,039
level one cache that's extremely fast

404
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,119
little two cache that's still pretty

405
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,750
fast

406
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,900
memory that's slow and discs that slow

407
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,930
as molasses in the winter

408
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:10,549
nevermind remote storage that's probably

409
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:11,039
twice as low as that it's got to go over

410
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:16,690
a network first depends on the network

411
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:18,279
of course ok so we start to think about

412
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:21,019
how it is that we can organize things in

413
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:24,500
memory to try to help things float to

414
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,529
the top faster levels so more of what we

415
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:31,630
use is up here and less of what we use

416
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,819
is in the molasses layers make sense

417
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:37,930
this is a memory referencing bugs

418
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,160
example if you want to know what a

419
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,359
memory bug looks like you can take a

420
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:42,940
look at it I don't want to spend a lot

421
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,079
of time looking at it now because we've

422
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,460
got a whole section talking about it and

423
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,839
I think you guys have probably

424
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:50,160
experienced plenty of memory bugs in

425
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,900
life but the answer is like in most

426
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,549
situations where you have these terrible

427
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:56,799
errors right the actual output of this

428
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,359
code will be different depending upon

429
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:01,880
the environment will be depending upon

430
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:06,279
exactly where it's executing and that

431
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,950
can make it hard to find a problem ok

432
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:14,319
unlike java python most higher-level

433
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:17,750
languages there's no intrinsic memory

434
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,630
protection in C it's possible that at

435
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:22,309
one point in your C program you

436
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:25,099
overwrite a variable and your program

437
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:29,190
continues to execute for milliseconds

438
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:33,539
seconds minutes hours days months years

439
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:35,769
decades you may wait around forever to

440
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:37,509
find out that the answer to you know to

441
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:43,039
the question of life and everything is

442
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:46,670
43 for those who didn't get that it's

443
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:50,308
obviously 42

444
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:52,579
okay why because you corrupted memory at

445
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:53,529
one point in life and didn't go back to

446
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:55,789
look at the memory you corrupted until

447
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:57,099
later

448
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:59,779
that's a terrible error can you imagine

449
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:03,400
trying to debug an error that happened

450
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:06,599
seventy years ago right

451
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,630
in fact when I'm programming on the

452
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,549
extremely rare I mean it happens like

453
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:17,380
once every 30 years in the extremely

454
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:21,130
rare case that I make a mistake and that

455
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:24,150
mistake was a memory error I thank God

456
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,480
for seg faults in fact what anybody who

457
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,109
doubts

458
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:32,259
I think seg faults or what hundreds of

459
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:34,099
percent positive proof more so than gaps

460
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:40,920
in the fossil record that in fact God

461
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:43,619
does exist and loves you every time I

462
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:50,289
get a segfault I say thank God God loves

463
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:53,369
me why because when I get a segfault my

464
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:55,279
program stops and says you have a

465
00:20:53,279 --> 00:21:02,529
problem and it's right here at this

466
00:20:55,529 --> 00:21:03,099
memory address okay that's great that's

467
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:05,839
a lot better than discovering that

468
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:09,849
problem 70 years later not knowing where

469
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:09,308
it is when I get the wrong answer

470
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:17,740
inexperienced programmers curse at seg

471
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:21,308
faults experienced programmers know they

472
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:25,179
got really lucky and now they know where

473
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:26,470
to start looking and I don't care about

474
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,609
your religion you can believe that God

475
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:29,799
loves you not it's fine

476
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:35,819
okay so she doesn't have the memory

477
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:38,930
protections of these higher-level

478
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:40,750
languages so we have to deal with that

479
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,160
we have to deal with the fact that we

480
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,269
may get a seg fault

481
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:48,630
or even worse we may not and our

482
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:51,019
programs may just keep running very

483
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:54,558
painful there's more performance than

484
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:56,049
asymptotic complexity you remember in

485
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:58,808
122 and 210 and whatever you know

486
00:21:56,808 --> 00:22:00,099
sophomore level data structures course

487
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:01,049
you happen to take you were talking

488
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:03,670
about algorithms analysis and they said

489
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,200
we always do is this thing called Big O

490
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,390
it's type of asymptotic analysis when

491
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,259
you look at what happens when the

492
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:09,549
problems become really really big

493
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:11,079
because you cares about dinky little

494
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,179
small problems anyway and we care about

495
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:16,519
the shape of the curve because

496
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,519
eventually that becomes controlling what

497
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:21,839
is eventually for something greater than

498
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:23,558
and not great okay talk about the

499
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:25,179
analysis some more and they say we throw

500
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:27,279
away the constant because it doesn't

501
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,410
control the shape of the curve it may

502
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:34,880
control its dilation but doesn't control

503
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:38,099
the shape forget the constant we care

504
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:41,929
about the end behavior cool but I'll

505
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:43,720
tell you this much as an end user I care

506
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,759
if something takes one second or ten

507
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:51,230
thousand seconds right

508
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,929
sometimes that constant actually matters

509
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:56,069
why don't you use the Kasden phone

510
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:58,509
instead of the samsung phone of the

511
00:22:56,509 --> 00:23:00,849
iphone i or the iphone you know look it

512
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:02,589
has essentially the same feature set but

513
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:07,450
the Kasden phone runs 10,000 times

514
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:09,460
slower let's start up instead of taking

515
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,049
one second after you enter your password

516
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:13,960
it'll take 10,000 seconds and when you

517
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,819
tap an icon instead of happening in a

518
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:20,910
millisecond it'll take a second

519
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:23,690
no one wouldn't use that phone right who

520
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:30,750
would use that phone no one right in the

521
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:32,049
real world those constants matter and in

522
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:33,119
the real world sometimes really small

523
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,950
things make a difference for reasons

524
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,109
we'll talk about later in the semester

525
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:40,940
if you look at these loops and you see I

526
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,579
and J and J and I you'll find that the

527
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:44,630
two loops

528
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:47,579
right those nested loops are in a

529
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:53,940
different order there one's ji ones I J

530
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:53,450
I nested within j vs J nested within I

531
00:23:53,450 --> 00:24:04,660
okay in this case right one version is

532
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:09,230
21 times slower at least on the Pentium

533
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:10,089
4 why we'll talk about that when we get

534
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:13,769
there but it has to do with that memory

535
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:16,169
hierarchy we talked about and using

536
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:19,640
things that are the faster parts of it

537
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,519
okay

538
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,960
computers do more than execute programs

539
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,819
well one of the important things that

540
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:34,279
we've got to think about it's ignored

541
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:37,440
many of the intro classes right is that

542
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,558
you've got to feed the beast if a

543
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:44,390
computer is doing data processing you

544
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:45,069
have to get the data in right this is

545
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:47,630
true for traditional data processing

546
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,579
it's true for you know big data

547
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:52,140
applications it's true for network

548
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,109
applications somehow right programs need

549
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:57,690
to process inputs it's only so much fun

550
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,599
to compute the digits of pi right at a

551
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:02,279
certain point computers want to solve

552
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:05,329
real world problems with real world data

553
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:08,759
so input is very important output is

554
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,130
also really important sometimes you want

555
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:13,839
the computer to processor to be able to

556
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:15,200
control the machine to do things the

557
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,419
output of a program right is actually

558
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:21,569
changing something about the device

559
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:23,019
making a phone ring turning a light on

560
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,308
right sometimes it's sending the data

561
00:25:23,308 --> 00:25:28,970
somewhere else

562
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:31,259
to disk to an SSD card over a network to

563
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:34,769
someone else right but unless we have

564
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:36,190
inputs we can't react to the real world

565
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,960
unless we have outputs we can't affect

566
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:44,480
the real world

567
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:47,369
io is really important the role within

568
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:49,909
our curriculum to thirteen five thirteen

569
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:52,919
is critically important for a huge

570
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,529
number of classes at the end of the day

571
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:56,960
any of the classes in CS or ECE that

572
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,009
function that required

573
00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:02,380
building things in software require 2:13

574
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,690
it's really that simple

575
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,890
that's not all there is to computer

576
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,630
science ok

577
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,009
there's a lot of theory that doesn't

578
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:11,990
require 2:13 that's not all there is to

579
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,269
engineering

580
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:16,470
ok there are a lot of aspects of

581
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,880
engineering that are very mathematical

582
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:25,490
ok or don't build things in software

583
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:28,410
will model them with software all right

584
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:30,650
but for a year's number of courses 2:13

585
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,269
is a prerequisite and this is only a

586
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:34,609
subset this doesn't include things like

587
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:40,230
the graphics classes and the animation

588
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:42,619
classes and and and and and ok 2:13 when

589
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:44,240
this course was first developed was

590
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,309
really revolutionary in computer science

591
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:49,740
education all the courses that tried to

592
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,319
do the same thing for year after year

593
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:56,700
after year for really decade after

594
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:58,039
decade were system centric ok

595
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,170
they were classes about the machine for

596
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:04,049
people that would build the machine

597
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:07,829
right 213 is different because it's a

598
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:10,410
course about these systems for the

599
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:12,430
people that program these systems and

600
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:14,299
that's a really different perspective

601
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:16,220
we're not writing the assembly we're

602
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:20,619
reading it we're not building the memory

603
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:22,220
controller we're optimizing for it does

604
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,960
that make sense

605
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,509
ok so we'll talk about hardware issues

606
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:32,779
computer architecture operating systems

607
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:39,789
compilers networking and so on

608
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:42,210
io subsystems but we're not going to

609
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:46,650
look at them in the perspective of those

610
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:51,529
no take notes dictionary will be

611
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:56,990
available later or raise your hand which

612
00:27:51,990 --> 00:28:00,940
term cash ok

613
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:04,230
see ACH e as opposed to see a sh cash I

614
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:06,440
mean cash like money is good too but but

615
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,509
cash in this case the literal definition

616
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:09,099
is something like a safe place to hide

617
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:12,809
things

618
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:15,930
like an arm's cash like the military is

619
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:17,329
gonna store a cache of guns somewhere in

620
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:19,039
case they need them later okay

621
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,079
but in the context of computer systems

622
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:23,089
it's fat it's a it's a it's a it's a

623
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:25,190
fast access layer that's smaller than a

624
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,349
larger slower access later so your

625
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:28,910
browser is a cache of pages you recently

626
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:33,650
looked at so you can go back and look at

627
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:35,779
them more quickly the you know the

628
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:37,640
memory hierarchy has a small amount of

629
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,680
really really fast memory so the things

630
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:43,450
that you use very frequently you don't

631
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:47,440
have to get at a slower memory that

632
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,400
answer question excellent okay so you

633
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,140
know there are a whole bunch of

634
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,460
different types of systems and we have

635
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,559
courses in all these areas right we have

636
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,700
a computer architecture course an

637
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,990
operating systems course I compiled of

638
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,549
course the networking course and abed

639
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:02,769
systems course right we of course is not

640
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:03,099
in you know in in storage systems and so

641
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:06,750
on those are for the people building

642
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:08,329
these things this course covers a slice

643
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:12,130
of all of that material for the people

644
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:16,059
using them okay the really serious

645
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:17,079
programmers okay our goal is to bring

646
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,970
out the hidden hacker and everyone and

647
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:23,279
we believe that there's a hacker and

648
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:26,400
everyone you and you and you and you and

649
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:31,789
even you look excited about your inner

650
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:36,289
hacker we're gonna find that hacker and

651
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:41,390
when we do he's gonna be excited I'm

652
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:44,609
promising we need a front camera so we

653
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:48,670
can zoom in on people everybody here but

654
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,710
me is missing the excitement on his face

655
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:55,759
how about you turn around show everyone

656
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,589
your excitement I want them to miss see

657
00:29:55,589 --> 00:30:01,980
that give him a turn around for just

658
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:07,079
second okay hold that pose while the

659
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:07,359
camera zooms you got them excellent

660
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:20,298
okay power programmers manage the flow

661
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:21,079
of data right you can't have processing

662
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,750
any faster than you can feed the beast

663
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,980
you've got to manage concurrency

664
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:29,779
concurrency is really really really

665
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:34,259
really really important right it used to

666
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:37,240
be the computer had the processor okay

667
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,529
now my cell phone has multiple cores

668
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:42,259
right your desktop has multiple cores

669
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:44,429
sometimes you take advantage of multiple

670
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:45,589
cores just by multitasking having you

671
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:47,909
Instant Messenger running on one your

672
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:48,079
operating system on another your word

673
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:51,609
processor on another and your browsers

674
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:54,960
run another that doesn't really take

675
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,788
application layer program but sometimes

676
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:57,750
you have something you want to

677
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,128
accomplish and you want to accomplish it

678
00:30:57,128 --> 00:31:02,440
quickly so you want to take all of that

679
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,169
processing power and use it to attack

680
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:08,599
the same task rather than dividing it up

681
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:10,648
among tasks and that gets tricky right

682
00:31:08,648 --> 00:31:14,808
the old saying about too many cooks in

683
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:17,769
the kitchen right if I have one cook in

684
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:20,109
the kitchen with one sink in one oven

685
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:23,980
right one countertop it might take 10

686
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,169
minutes to do something if I have two

687
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:26,009
cooks in the kitchen

688
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:29,440
I can't accomplish the same thing twice

689
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,798
in 20 minutes necessarily right if I

690
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:33,359
want to bake a cake and bacon cake takes

691
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:35,878
45 minutes if I have one cook it might

692
00:31:33,878 --> 00:31:37,829
you know takes that 45 minutes right if

693
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:39,480
I put another cook into the kitchen I'm

694
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:43,429
not gonna end up with two cakes and 45

695
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:45,269
minutes in fact if they both put flour

696
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:51,220
into the same Bowl I may end up with no

697
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:54,159
cakes right if one of them turns the

698
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,519
oven on right two cakes may go in and

699
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,990
then the first one in turns the oven off

700
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:00,109
the second cake never gets finished

701
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:04,038
there's a lot of opportunity for

702
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:07,659
concurrency control problems right maybe

703
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:11,628
there's only one you know one mixer and

704
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:16,079
now either somebody needs to way eat or

705
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:18,148
there's gonna be a fight one Baker will

706
00:32:16,148 --> 00:32:18,930
live

707
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:38,430
the other fought the good fight okay the

708
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:42,480
teaching staff perfect myself seth

709
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,049
goldstein friends Franchetti so the

710
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:46,930
three of us in the faculty you care

711
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,369
about us I mean we're there to help you

712
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:51,519
and we also have have up like a dozen

713
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,680
dozen and a half TAS I think we've hired

714
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,599
a dozen so far I think we let 150 people

715
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:58,849
off the waitlist yesterday so I think

716
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:59,099
we're hiring another six something like

717
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:00,660
that so I think I think technically

718
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:04,890
speaking there's 13 today there will be

719
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:08,160
18 by the end of the week the TAS are

720
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:10,420
tremendous tremendous you will love them

721
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,220
because they'll hold all these office

722
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,019
hours and the TAS hold office hours like

723
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:14,089
for several hours a day you know six

724
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:17,950
days a week

725
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,059
faculty members move a few office hours

726
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:20,799
with the TAS have many many more why

727
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,450
there are a lot more of them than there

728
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,670
are us they'll answer questions on your

729
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,740
yun you know on your email like we will

730
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,599
- right but if you mail mail the staff

731
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:31,910
list all of the TAS get the email as

732
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:33,579
well as all the faculty right so if

733
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:34,440
there are 18 TAS and three of us there's

734
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,789
six times as likely to answer than we

735
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:41,230
are right it's great so we're part of it

736
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:46,900
but the the TAS or another part of it so

737
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:47,160
15 to 13 verses eighteen to thirteen -

738
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,420
thirteen eighteen to thirteen of based

739
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:53,309
on the only undergraduates five thirteen

740
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:57,930
of masters students - thirteen you know

741
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:59,319
gets live lectures and recitations five

742
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:01,930
thirteen basically is gonna be delivered

743
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:04,519
by video the thought there is that

744
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,400
masters students you know having more

745
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,690
experience more time more time

746
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,849
management are able to you know watch

747
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:09,139
the video on their own time and get the

748
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:11,889
value out of it

749
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:12,210
whereas experience has shown that

750
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,500
undergraduates need a little more

751
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,900
structure we're gonna style grade into

752
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,610
thirteen but not in five thirteen and

753
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,750
the reason there is just that we think

754
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,920
we need to provide that input to

755
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,449
undergraduates who are earlier in their

756
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:24,760
careers but graduate students who either

757
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,289
program you know programmed as

758
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:28,300
undergraduates and gotten that feedback

759
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,190
already or programmed in industry to

760
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,929
even if his engineers just need that

761
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:32,588
feedback a little less

762
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:37,779
everything else is the same the TA isn't

763
00:34:35,779 --> 00:34:38,518
the same the faculty is the same the

764
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:40,869
lecture materials content the same the

765
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:44,128
labs are the same blah blah blah blah

766
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:50,268
blah textbook the revolutionary Brian

767
00:34:44,268 --> 00:34:50,208
did O'Halloran book okay

768
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:53,159
I say revolutionary because it really

769
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,779
was it was the first book that took this

770
00:34:53,779 --> 00:34:59,418
programmer centered view of systems for

771
00:34:56,418 --> 00:35:01,389
the sophomore level courses been adopted

772
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:04,159
by all the top universities in the globe

773
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:05,130
basically what's really cool about it is

774
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:08,929
Randy actually is a faculty member here

775
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:10,568
he was our Dean until until until July

776
00:35:08,568 --> 00:35:14,909
and Dave O'Halloran is also a faculty

777
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:16,150
member here now let me suggest that you

778
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:19,358
actually legitimately buy the book as

779
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:22,130
opposed to ripping a copy from I don't

780
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,219
know one of those random sites why you

781
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:26,108
asked did you legitimately buy the copy

782
00:35:24,108 --> 00:35:28,599
of the book instead of Ripa PDF from

783
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:31,849
somewhere so here's I'd like to ask you

784
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:35,909
to do either by a legitimate copy of the

785
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:39,630
book or go visit Dave in his office with

786
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:40,380
your PDF copy and say hi Dave I have a

787
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,548
question for you about two-thirty no

788
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:45,338
cool because he loves to thirteen and

789
00:35:43,338 --> 00:35:51,380
then plop down your laptop with it with

790
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:55,949
a textbook to answer your question BOC

791
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:57,279
steam coming out of his ears because it

792
00:35:55,279 --> 00:36:00,708
takes a huge amount of effort right to

793
00:35:57,708 --> 00:36:03,199
prayer and publish the textbook a huge

794
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:04,170
amount he's here I have my office down

795
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:06,458
the hall from him he's here to like 2:00

796
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:08,619
or 3:00 in the morning right you know

797
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:11,568
like every couple of years for like six

798
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:13,929
months revising it and apparently when

799
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:15,579
you publish a textbook so I'm told the

800
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:16,079
textbook company keeps most of the money

801
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,639
and like the people who write it get

802
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:19,989
like you know pennies on the you know

803
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:21,309
like a couple dollars per book or

804
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:24,228
something right but when you like rip

805
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:25,349
the PDF copy they get nothing and so he

806
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,969
actually is here and I can attest to it

807
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:30,318
right until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning

808
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:33,409
like for six months every couple of

809
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:35,949
years it's this huge investment so it

810
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:40,599
didn't really is cheating him and Randi

811
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:41,579
if you don't actually buy the book the

812
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:44,719
course components there are the lectures

813
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:46,838
these are great my favorite part

814
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:48,818
then my favorite part is only part they

815
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:51,108
let me do anymore I can't take that one

816
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:53,949
let me do the latter dental apps the

817
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:56,748
recitations the recitations are really

818
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:57,568
good because their problem sessions okay

819
00:36:56,568 --> 00:36:58,949
I tend to talk about the things are

820
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,429
important

821
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:03,099
my job right I I believe my job is

822
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:06,079
somebody lecturing is to communicate to

823
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:09,259
you what you need to learn right and why

824
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:11,829
you need to learn it and something about

825
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:13,989
how to go about learning it and if you

826
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:16,518
leave lecture knowing those three things

827
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:18,998
knowing what you need to learn motivated

828
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:19,318
to learn it understanding why it's

829
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:21,759
important why you should learn it and

830
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:24,920
knowing how to go about learning it I've

831
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,498
been successful in lecture I don't think

832
00:37:24,498 --> 00:37:32,559
you can you can absorb all of 15 to 13

833
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:35,210
in the I don't know what it is you know

834
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:37,420
we have 15 weeks now and a half we've in

835
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:43,900
three hours a week 45 hours of lecture

836
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:45,039
she's not possible okay what you can do

837
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,380
is learn what you need to learn learn

838
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:50,478
why it's important and how to go about

839
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:52,599
learning it I think that's why lecture

840
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:54,880
is important and then you can go right

841
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,440
and you can start reading your textbook

842
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:00,039
you can start doing your labs doing the

843
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:03,880
problems and then you can actually learn

844
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,380
okay and so lectures are important

845
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,818
because they help you understand what

846
00:38:04,818 --> 00:38:07,289
you need to learn why you need to learn

847
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:10,869
it and how to go about learning it's

848
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:12,099
recitations are really important because

849
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:16,739
it's an example it's it's a great forum

850
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:19,338
for seeing examples okay what's an

851
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:21,909
important part of learning the labs are

852
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:23,588
critically important and perhaps the

853
00:38:21,588 --> 00:38:27,088
most important parts but you shouldn't

854
00:38:23,088 --> 00:38:29,018
get your finger nails just dug in right

855
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:32,119
that's what real learning happens right

856
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,239
the rubber reads the meets the road it

857
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:37,318
actually gets your fingers I didn't

858
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:40,460
start to do things okay and studying for

859
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:42,489
the exams the midterm and final is also

860
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:43,289
a critical part of the course because in

861
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:47,940
studying for those exams they're problem

862
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,028
oriented exams you'll get a lot of

863
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:51,798
experience solving very interesting

864
00:38:48,798 --> 00:38:54,259
problems and you're gonna learn a lot so

865
00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:57,498
I think it all works together and now

866
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:58,018
right now I'm gonna give you right and

867
00:38:57,018 --> 00:39:01,650
our studio audience

868
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:03,588
and our distance audience the secret to

869
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:07,978
getting perfect scores on the exam okay

870
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:10,858
on the course website we have published

871
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:12,228
like every exam problem we gave from

872
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:16,978
like 1999 through a couple years ago

873
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:19,789
okay so here is what you should do in

874
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:21,650
the next couple of days go and print

875
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:25,509
every exam we gave in the last five

876
00:39:21,509 --> 00:39:30,460
years every midterm and every final

877
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:33,768
print them out and then take the last

878
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:39,358
two or three semesters that we have and

879
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:40,028
just sit them aside hole okay the most

880
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:41,529
recent two or three midterms the most

881
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:45,789
recent two or three finals that are up

882
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:47,630
on the website take the rest and sort

883
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:49,849
them by problem type you'll see the

884
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:51,978
problems tend to fall into a few

885
00:39:49,978 --> 00:39:56,449
different categories of problems and

886
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:59,579
just make a stack okay integer problems

887
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:03,279
floating point problems simple assembly

888
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:06,329
problems struct problems okay

889
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:10,329
virtual memory problems process control

890
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:14,039
problems concurrency control problems

891
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:16,429
okay make several piles and then when we

892
00:40:14,429 --> 00:40:17,318
come to lecture we're going to tell you

893
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:19,429
all about things right

894
00:40:17,429 --> 00:40:20,018
we'll have electron integers a couple of

895
00:40:19,018 --> 00:40:22,429
lectures on floating point numbers blah

896
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:28,529
blah blah blah blah so here's what you

897
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:30,349
do after lecture review your notes read

898
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:32,298
The Associated part of your textbook and

899
00:40:30,298 --> 00:40:39,338
then go straight for that pile of

900
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:42,088
problems and start doing them check your

901
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:44,779
answers the answers are there to do them

902
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:49,818
until they're boring not because you're

903
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:50,079
tired but because they're all easy get

904
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,579
help if you need them if there's some

905
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:54,048
you can't get help you can't figure out

906
00:40:52,048 --> 00:40:57,619
talk to your friends friends are great

907

914
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:23,929
answer if you say hey right now I'm

915
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:27,469
having trouble with this alright do that

916
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:30,400
every class don't let yourself get more

917
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,639
than a class behind ever okay try to do

918
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,159
Tuesday Tuesday night or Wednesday try

919
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:37,889
to do Thursday Thursday night or Friday

920
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:39,539
if you fall behind get caught up over

921
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:43,789
the weekend or Monday but don't go into

922
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:46,688
Tuesday not being caught up if you do

923
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:49,119
that you're basically guaranteed to get

924
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:52,688
an a on the exam nothing here is so

925
00:41:49,688 --> 00:41:54,239
complicated that the that anybody who

926
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:58,969
gets into Carnegie Mellon can't do okay

927
00:41:54,969 --> 00:42:00,208
nothing some people will find it easier

928
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:02,369
than others that's okay it'll take more

929
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:04,048
some people you know more or less time

930
00:42:02,048 --> 00:42:06,449
to learn than others that's okay too if

931
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:10,938
you keep up as you go along everyone

932
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:17,719
here can get an A it's really that

933
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:25,768
simple okay can you stop texting don't

934
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:32,559
text put your phone away

935
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:33,108
okay so that's the secret then about two

936
00:42:32,108 --> 00:42:36,730
weeks before the midterm you remember I

937
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:42,239
told you to set about three exams aside

938
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:44,480
take one whole exam from start to finish

939
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,739
give yourself an hour and a half to two

940
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:51,539
hours to do it see how you do if

941
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:53,579
anything was uncomfortable to you or if

942
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:56,590
you missed anything go back to your pile

943
00:42:53,590 --> 00:43:00,969
of exam problems and drive down again

944
00:42:56,969 --> 00:43:03,190
until you're comfortable then go back

945
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:08,608
and take another exam repeat is

946
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:09,289
necessary you'll be getting a hundreds

947
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:13,909
on the exam I think before you get them

948
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:15,239
three practice exams that way if not go

949
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:17,340
to your pile of exams and make yourself

950
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:19,889
a new exam one problem Adam you know one

951
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:20,449
problem a one problem B you want problem

952
00:43:19,449 --> 00:43:22,650
C one problem do you one problem a

953
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:27,119
staple there you go there's a new

954
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:30,809
practice exam repeat until you got it

955
00:43:27,809 --> 00:43:33,010
when it comes to the final do the same

956
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:36,539
thing okay

957
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:37,699
that's the secret somewhere in the

958
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:39,809
syllabus I think it still has the

959
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:41,010
language that says to prepare for the

960
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:43,909
exam read the textbook three times I

961
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:45,929
mean do that if you want that was

962
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:47,219
written by the person who wrote the

963
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:47,550
textbook

964
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:55,199
but my feeling is dive into the problems

965
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:58,380
okay

966
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:00,050
read the textbook as you go right

967
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:03,539
reading the textbook if you're confused

968
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:05,500
and miss a problem it's a great resource

969
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,579
but when it comes to the two weeks

970
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:09,349
before an exam I wouldn't dive right

971
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:11,090
back to the textbook I would dive to

972
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:14,730
your you know to your problems do them

973
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:17,670
as you go review your notes read the

974
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:20,070
section the textbook do the problems

975
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:23,489
until they're boring do that all

976
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:27,670
semester it'll probably take you three

977
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:32,920
hours to do that right twice a week

978
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:36,940
maybe four probably three okay but then

979
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:39,320
when you get to the midterm you're ready

980
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,300
you'll take two midterms three hours of

981
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:45,530
work and you're ready for the midterm

982
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:53,300
exam no stress no fuss no mess full

983
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:55,300
confidence does that make sense okay

984
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,889
getting help the course webpage is a

985
00:44:55,889 --> 00:44:59,119
bunch of resources including the

986
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,099
including the lectures the exams the

987
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:03,380
assignments and so on we don't use

988
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,449
blackboard for the course except for the

989
00:45:03,449 --> 00:45:08,449
fact that it's used to authenticate

990
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:10,670
access to the videos so if you were

991
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:13,949
enrolled in fifteen five thirteen you

992
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:14,469
have access to the videos I do not

993
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:16,639
believe at this point in time we're

994
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:18,110
going to make them accessible to the to

995
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,030
thirteen students we're going to talk

996
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:25,289
about that the staff meeting we have on

997
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:30,349
Thursday okay we won't be using Piazza I

998
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:32,500
get asked a lot why don't you use Piazza

999
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:36,429
okay

1000
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:41,329
the reason I don't use Piazza is I don't

1001
00:45:36,329 --> 00:45:43,550
think it improves learning period okay

1002
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:46,739
that is the singular reason I don't

1003
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:50,170
believe in using Piazza and here's why

1004
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:52,840
okay when you guys go to do labs

1005
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,860
you're gonna start writing the lab

1006
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:56,300
you're gonna run into some problem

1007
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,280
you're gonna try to push and push and

1008
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,869
push and eventually you'll figure out

1009
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:03,980
what the problem is and try to solve it

1010
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,329
occasional you'll get stuck and email

1011
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:06,829
the staff list and we'll figure out

1012
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:09,239
where you are and give you some hints

1013
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:12,989
and help you get unstuck so you as

1014
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:14,599
students are gonna have to learn to find

1015
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:16,400
the property notice out you know to

1016
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,469
solve a bigger problem define the small

1017
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:22,599
stumbling blocks and to push at them and

1018
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:23,079
to ask questions about it what happens

1019
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,969
with Piazza as nearly as I can tell is

1020
00:46:23,969 --> 00:46:29,550
the first cohort of students to start

1021
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:32,159
and move the fastest run into all the

1022
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:34,309
interesting cases they asked about them

1023
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:36,170
in on the bulletin boards they get

1024
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:39,358
answers and then what happens is

1025
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:40,210
everybody following behind them doesn't

1026
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:43,940
have the opportunity to think about it

1027
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:45,829
they've already been predisposed to know

1028
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:48,809
where the problems are and predisposed

1029
00:46:45,809 --> 00:46:49,150
to know about the solutions and now

1030
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,920
they're not learning the problem solving

1031
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,389
they're not learning the issue spotting

1032
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:55,219
they're not learning to think about I

1033
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:56,139
have a problem and I have tools which

1034
00:46:55,139 --> 00:46:58,429
tools the right one to use for the

1035
00:46:56,429 --> 00:47:00,559
problem they're told when you get here

1036
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,690
use this tool when you get here use this

1037
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:07,670
tool they're getting a much cheaper

1038
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:08,230
experience and so yes it does

1039
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:10,670
dramatically decrease the number of

1040
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:11,019
questions that are asked on the staff

1041
00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:13,969
list view Piazza it does decrease the

1042
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:15,199
number of times you have to answer the

1043
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,150
same question will answer the same

1044
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:20,099
question sometimes 80 times on the staff

1045
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:22,338
list it's unusual for it to be that many

1046
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:24,409
but it could happen occasionally does

1047
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:26,630
more often than not whence the same

1048
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:28,460
question in the class this size five to

1049
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:31,769
a dozen times and you know what that's

1050
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:34,920
okay I am happy to answer your question

1051
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,469
when you ask it and give you the answer

1052
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:38,329
that's right for you and answer your

1053
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:40,219
question when you ask it and give you

1054
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:42,980
the answer that's right for you and to

1055
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,900
give everybody the right answer to the

1056
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:48,579
right question that most importantly at

1057
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:52,630
the right time so my goal in avoiding

1058
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:57,050
Piazza is to ensure that students learn

1059
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:58,239
as much as possible period right even if

1060
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:00,619
that means that we answer more questions

1061
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:01,300
on the mailing list even if that means

1062
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,769
we answer questions repetitively on the

1063
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:04,630
mailing list when we see that we're

1064
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,800
getting asked questions repair of the

1065
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,170
mailing list we have a choice right we

1066
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:10,849
can say this is great these people

1067
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:12,139
running into this interesting probably

1068
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:14,269
want them to some of them we encourage

1069
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:15,469
some of them we help whatever or Wiggins

1070
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:19,730
you know what we should have really

1071
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:20,239
explained that better we now know that

1072
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:24,980
eighty people are confused about it and

1073
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:26,250
now we can improve the course as opposed

1074
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,260
to on Piazza where the first person runs

1075
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:34,670
into it we answered everybody else

1076
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:38,679
season we have no idea common that is so

1077
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:40,320
that's my story on Piazza I'm sticking

1078
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,369
to it

1079
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:45,108
getting help the fastest thing to do for

1080
00:48:44,108 --> 00:48:49,519
help is send an email to the staff list

1081
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:51,750
why somewhere between 13 and 18 people

1082
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:53,820
plus three faculties of sixteen to

1083
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,170
twenty one people are gonna be

1084
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:57,840
monitoring that list it's much better

1085
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,670
than mailing just me because well I'm in

1086
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,070
here teaching this class right now or my

1087
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:04,079
other class at 1:30 or and staff means

1088
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:08,480
at 4:30 right some TA is answering

1089
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:10,949
questions on that list right when I'm up

1090
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:12,630
until 3:00 a.m. I'm answering questions

1091
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:13,369
that list where the early risers on

1092
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:16,599
staff probably starts answering

1093
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:19,358
questions at 7:30 in the morning right

1094
00:49:16,358 --> 00:49:22,800
it's just a whole bunch more opportunity

1095
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,389
office hours will be starting on this

1096
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:26,608
Sunday they can run Sunday Monday

1097
00:49:24,608 --> 00:49:28,230
Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday not on

1098
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,349
Friday or Saturday because no one comes

1099
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:32,730
we're gonna go from 6:30 to 8:00 p.m.

1100
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:33,679
and we're still talking about what room

1101
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:35,909
is gonna be held in so give us a couple

1102
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:37,800
more days on that we'll know that on

1103
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,300
Thursday afternoon you know we're gonna

1104
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,500
talk about it turning our staff meeting

1105
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:43,300
um if you really need a one-on-one

1106
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:46,599
appointment then feel free to request

1107
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:49,389
one in general it's best just to show up

1108
00:49:46,389 --> 00:49:52,869
at office hours because you know a

1109
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:53,269
you'll get your question answered be you

1110
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:55,800
can sort of be part of a discussion that

1111
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:59,780
may involve others and some of their

1112
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,588
questions may be interesting to you too

1113
00:50:01,588 --> 00:50:05,329
you're also likely to find office hours

1114
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:07,710
you know from 6 to 8 p.m. which is

1115
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:08,449
really easy to get there and one-on-one

1116
00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:15,858
appointments may take a day or two to

1117
00:50:08,858 --> 00:50:16,010
schedule work groups so you must work a

1118
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,449
lot on assignments your assignments are

1119
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:22,780
to be done individually ok don't work on

1120
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:24,480
teams bla bla bla bla bla but study

1121
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,880
groups are great for doing the practice

1122
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,949
problems they are fantastic

1123
00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:31,900
right order some pizza get together with

1124
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:35,789
three or four friends do five or six

1125
00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:37,210
problems you'll have a good time of more

1126
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:38,130
fun than doing it by yourself when

1127
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,269
somebody has a different approach to a

1128
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:41,530
problem than you do you'll get to see

1129
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:42,570
that too if you get stuck on a problem

1130
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,889
somebody else will be able to explain it

1131
00:50:42,889 --> 00:50:48,280
to you

1132
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:53,829
and vice-versa it'll be great hand ins

1133
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:56,329
are generally due at midnight 11:59 p.m.

1134
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:59,179
so if we say it's due Tuesday it's due

1135
00:50:56,179 --> 00:51:05,929
before Wednesday right 11:59 59 you know

1136
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:08,809
p.m. on Tuesday if there's some

1137
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:10,449
irreducible conflict let us know there's

1138
00:51:08,449 --> 00:51:12,070
not going to be because we're gonna do

1139
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,108
electronic exams this semester and so

1140
00:51:12,108 --> 00:51:16,429
you'll be able to schedule the time slot

1141
00:51:13,429 --> 00:51:17,099
of your own choosing so there shouldn't

1142
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:19,960
be any of those conflicts if there's a

1143
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,429
problem rating please let us know within

1144
00:51:19,429 --> 00:51:23,099
a week do it in writing that way we

1145
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:24,300
don't lose track about it we can talk

1146
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,949
about it at the staff meeting if you ask

1147
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:27,690
one of us in the hallway we don't have

1148
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:30,858
the opportunity to chat about it at the

1149
00:51:27,858 --> 00:51:34,530
staff meeting right because like we're

1150
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:36,159
never gonna remember the syllabus has a

1151
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:39,800
detailed procedure basically it says you

1152
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:42,650
know tell us what the problem is slided

1153
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,679
under one of the faculty members doors

1154
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:48,940
you know in terms of computing resources

1155
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:52,949
we can use the machines donated by Intel

1156
00:51:48,949 --> 00:51:59,338
short Dell ICS that CSF Samhita edu or a

1157
00:51:52,338 --> 00:52:00,119
UNIX dot Andrew either work you get five

1158
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,920
great stays this semester the last

1159
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,969
assignment is due in the last

1160
00:52:01,969 --> 00:52:06,409
assignments due you can't use any great

1161
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:07,440
stays there the reason for that is we

1162
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,699
want to make sure that people don't push

1163
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:12,440
that assignment late and then get

1164
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,349
stressed out for finals at certain point

1165
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:20,329
it's better just to draw the line turn

1166
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:23,210
it in sync point write lateness penalty

1167
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:25,000
after you use your grace days order the

1168
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,039
limit of two grade stays per lab there's

1169
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:31,880
a 15% penalty per day no hand ins after

1170
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,039
three days so the most late you can be

1171
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:35,010
on an assignment is three days late the

1172
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,449
reason for that is to make sure that you

1173
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:39,230
have enough time to do the next

1174
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:40,650
assignment right comes to that sync

1175
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:42,840
point thing

1176
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,579
in the event something really bad

1177
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:48,380
happens a major illness death and family

1178
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:50,940
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah this lateness

1179
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:53,769
penalty stuff is obviously not the right

1180
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:56,199
answer for that right that stuff that

1181
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:59,590
affects you across all of your courses

1182
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,199
go talk to your academic advisor explain

1183
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,909
to your academic advisor what's happened

1184
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:04,949
where you sit in your classes and put

1185
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:06,210
together a plan to get caught up and

1186
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:10,670
then your academic advisor will email us

1187
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:12,539
and say hey you know this person you

1188
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:15,429
know this person you know needs you to

1189
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:17,010
do this for them okay and then we will

1190
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:19,079
if your academic advisor says give you

1191
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:20,420
you know ten extra days that's fine your

1192
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,980
academic advisor says they get caught up

1193
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:25,840
over spring break that's fine whatever

1194
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,179
it is we don't care right as long as we

1195
00:53:25,179 --> 00:53:28,320
know you've chatted with your academic

1196
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,119
advisor and it's gonna be part of a good

1197
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:33,079
solution for you

1198
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:35,699
we're okay with it big advice we have is

1199
00:53:33,699 --> 00:53:36,260
once you start getting behind it's

1200
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,639
really hard to get caught up right

1201
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:41,949
because to get caught up you'll be able

1202
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:43,289
to maintain the normal course pace plus

1203
00:53:41,289 --> 00:53:47,780
the catch-up stuff right that's much

1204
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:51,980
harder than just keeping pace so start

1205
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:53,130
early is our general advice work hard

1206
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:58,230
finish early all that good stuff okay

1207
00:53:53,230 --> 00:54:00,300
look don't cheat here's what we know

1208
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,969
okay we know that this is perhaps the

1209
00:54:00,969 --> 00:54:05,800
best-selling textbook for this course

1210
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,559
anywhere in the world we know this set

1211
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:09,570
of labs that come with a textbook right

1212
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:12,460
is perhaps the most popular set of labs

1213
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:13,010
for this course anywhere in the world we

1214
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:16,989
know that students all over the world

1215
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:21,510
have posted answers to these labs in any

1216
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:24,190
number of forums okay Dave O'Halloran

1217
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:26,460
has made it his life's mission to find

1218
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:29,769
every one of these and add them to our

1219
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:33,289
database of solutions that we use when

1220
00:54:29,289 --> 00:54:37,699
we run mas okay it's run automatically

1221
00:54:33,699 --> 00:54:40,570
by Auto lab every time you turn in a

1222
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:44,989
solution okay

1223
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:47,530
Auto lab has it and then at the end of

1224
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:49,559
the lab moss is run and gives the report

1225
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:51,719
of what solutions match each other and

1226
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:53,429
what solutions match the ones Dave is

1227
00:54:51,429 --> 00:54:53,340
put in there

1228
00:54:54,340 --> 00:55:00,250
okay now I'm the one who follows up on

1229
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:02,650
those I can assure you I follow up on

1230
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:04,630
every one of those but those of you who

1231
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,039
know me know there's an expression on

1232
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:09,610
campus

1233
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:13,829
it's called Kasdan time five minutes

1234
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:16,639
late ish okay I don't necessarily follow

1235
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:19,400
up on those immediately so if you turn

1236
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,599
in a solution to a lab and it's copied

1237
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:23,889
it's not like red lights are going to

1238
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:26,510
flash and bells are going to ring all at

1239
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:30,840
once if you do that for three labs in a

1240
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:32,619
row I may not notice until I get around

1241
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:37,599
to looking at the mas results the last

1242
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:41,420
couple of weeks of the semester but I do

1243
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:43,150
we prosecuted 20-some odd cases of

1244
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:45,300
cheating last semester

1245
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,349
two students were thrown out of the

1246
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:49,690
University

1247
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:52,219
one more is a hearing come up coming up

1248
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:56,460
to discuss the same don't cheat it's

1249
00:55:52,460 --> 00:56:00,119
really serious okay

1250
00:55:56,119 --> 00:56:03,500
I mean in one case you know I submitted

1251
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,469
the report that you know within days of

1252
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:08,940
another instructor submitting a report

1253
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:11,269
that student got thrown out in two other

1254
00:56:08,269 --> 00:56:14,199
cases it was a second offense that you

1255
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:17,570
know in another case we don't know the

1256
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:18,090
outcome of this one I don't think yet it

1257
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:21,739
was somebody who cheated twice in 213 a

1258
00:56:18,739 --> 00:56:21,849
year apart

1259
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:32,108
just don't weaken google - okay my

1260
00:56:31,108 --> 00:56:35,940
personal favorite cave I have several

1261
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,429
personal favorite cases one of my

1262
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:39,929
personal favorite cases if somebody was

1263
00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:40,150
at a Google dinner a Google intern

1264
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:43,768
dinner okay

1265
00:56:40,768 --> 00:56:46,619
bragging about how she did all of her

1266
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:53,798
labs all the labs from her boyfriend who

1267
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:54,400
is a Stanford student great well who

1268
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,809
else is sitting around the table at a

1269
00:56:54,809 --> 00:57:02,949
Google intern dinner do you think right

1270
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:05,789
a bunch of - 13 TAS who happen to be

1271
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:06,190
Google interns or at least were at some

1272
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:07,119
point in their career

1273
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:09,559
okay so I don't remember whether it's

1274
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:11,028
actually a Google intern or one of the

1275
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:14,849
Google mentors but it took like six

1276
00:57:11,849 --> 00:57:16,429
seconds from the dinner table right for

1277
00:57:14,429 --> 00:57:20,498
somebody to tap the text both me and the

1278
00:57:16,498 --> 00:57:27,940
instructor at Stanford that person got

1279
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:29,298
bust both of them got busted right don't

1280
00:57:27,298 --> 00:57:31,849
I just I don't know I don't know how it

1281
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:33,858
is that we managed to bust anybody

1282
00:57:31,858 --> 00:57:36,719
during the semester because you know

1283
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:43,150
what we do we have all of your solutions

1284
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:44,048
in auto lab we run moss against them and

1285
00:57:43,048 --> 00:57:47,969
if you think that Stanford and CMU and

1286
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:49,400
Berkeley and MIT you know and Cornell

1287
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,170
and so on are very far apart take a look

1288
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:54,849
at our faculties and realize that we're

1289
00:57:50,849 --> 00:57:58,480
all alums from other places right our

1290
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:04,380
students mix right you know it's just

1291
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:06,018
not gonna work for you my other personal

1292
00:58:04,018 --> 00:58:10,690
favorite was the case where a student

1293
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:14,858
cheated the code exactly matched

1294
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:16,880
something from github that Dave

1295
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,318
O'Halloran found and put it in the

1296
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:21,929
database thanks Dave

1297
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:22,568
this that I call a student in my office

1298
00:58:21,568 --> 00:58:25,829
the student immediately starts

1299
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:26,889
confessing which is good I mean that's

1300
00:58:25,889 --> 00:58:30,909
actually the right way for this to

1301
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:33,420
happen right but the problem is the

1302
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:36,900
students confession didn't match what I

1303
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:38,239
was looking at I was looking at the

1304
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:41,739
students code and github code

1305
00:58:38,739 --> 00:58:43,800
and they were exactly the same and the

1306
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:48,300
student was confessing to getting too

1307
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:50,940
much help the student said I am so so

1308
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,500
sorry I know I shouldn't have done it I

1309
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,119
was having a whole bunch of trouble with

1310
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:55,500
the course that was really struggling

1311
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:58,659
and my my father decided that he needed

1312
00:58:55,659 --> 00:59:01,210
to hire me a teacher to help me and so

1313
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:02,000
he got me this teacher and I got too

1314
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,619
much help from this teacher and I know

1315
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:07,940
what I know I shouldn't have gotten that

1316
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:09,329
much help and I said well that's really

1317
00:59:07,329 --> 00:59:10,489
interesting and he said no no I'm so

1318
00:59:09,489 --> 00:59:12,780
sorry the guy's practically in tears

1319
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:15,670
confessing to getting too much help from

1320
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:17,460
this teacher I said but the problem here

1321
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:19,230
is that your lab matches github

1322
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:21,690
I don't nothing about this teacher he

1323
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:27,420
says no it can't

1324
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:30,789
yes yes it does dear and so apparently

1325
00:59:27,789 --> 00:59:32,519
his father hired him this faculty member

1326
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:34,079
at the University of Outer Mongolia I'm

1327
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,329
not making that up some some teacher

1328
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:38,849
Peng and there's some Chinese equivalent

1329
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:41,559
of Skype and so he Skyped with this

1330
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:43,440
person in China who helped him with his

1331
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,239
lab and apparently the way this guy

1332
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:52,858
helped him was by feeding him lines

1333
00:59:44,858 --> 00:59:54,210
three lines at a time from github so as

1334
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:58,519
nearly as I can tell neither the student

1335
00:59:54,519 --> 00:00:01,929
nor teacher Peng could do the lab so

1336
00:59:58,929 --> 00:00:03,090
this poor person's father paid this

1337
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:06,489
teacher in China to rip code from github

1338
01:00:03,489 --> 01:00:15,039
and feed it to him over some Chinese

1339
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:20,608
skype like service um don't cheat we

1340
01:00:15,608 --> 01:00:23,199
will catch you we will really honestly

1341
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:25,559
truly it's not there it's not like work

1342
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:27,510
it's just is not hard we have a database

1343
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:30,608
of solutions and a tool that compares

1344
01:00:27,608 --> 01:00:36,309
them there's a button on the lab panel

1345
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:38,219
that says find cheaters run boss don't

1346
01:00:36,219 --> 01:00:38,550
cheat

1347
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:41,510
laptops are admitted of course for

1348
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:43,829
looking at slides you previously

1349
01:00:41,829 --> 01:00:45,840
downloaded or taking notes but not for

1350
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:48,900
electronically mediated communication

1351
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:51,179
presidents and lectures is voluntary

1352
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:51,460
take no recordings of any kind will

1353
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:56,739
prove

1354
01:00:51,739 --> 01:00:58,000
the videos for the 5:13 crowd exams 20%

1355
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,190
for the midterm 30% for the final labs

1356
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:04,179
count half their weight varies the

1357
01:01:02,179 --> 01:01:09,130
simpler shorter labs count less than the

1358
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:11,469
longer more involved labs topics

1359
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:14,480
integers floating point arithmetic

1360
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:19,838
assembly language programs how C you

1361
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:20,369
know you know C is represented in

1362
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:22,900
assembly data structures represented

1363
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:25,579
assembly certain aspects of architecture

1364
01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:27,280
and compilers the first three labs play

1365
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:31,920
with those topics next topics topics we

1366
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:34,219
cover the memory hierarchy caches disks

1367
01:01:31,219 --> 01:01:35,039
spatial and temporal locality and

1368
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:37,119
certain other aspects of how the

1369
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:40,670
operating systems manage these the cache

1370
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:42,940
lab lab 4 covers these Hardware

1371
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:46,829
exceptions processes process control

1372
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:48,579
UNIX signals non-local jumps this is

1373
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:50,500
covered by lab 5 the teach lab will you

1374
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:52,869
write a shell virtual memory address

1375
01:01:50,869 --> 01:01:54,159
translation and that mix storage

1376
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:58,469
allocation caching involved there like

1377
01:01:54,469 --> 01:02:01,179
the TLB this is tested in the Mallik lab

1378
01:01:58,179 --> 01:02:05,579
networking and guernsey control this is

1379
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:07,690
tested in proxy lab ok

1380
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:09,909
the idea behind all these labs the same

1381
01:02:07,909 --> 01:02:11,889
give you a well-defined goal some

1382
01:02:09,889 --> 01:02:16,900
problem to solve and let you lose to

1383
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:19,460
actually build the solution you'll pick

1384
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:21,460
a handle a name that's not yours nor the

1385
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:22,380
name of you know any faculty member or

1386
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:25,900
TA

1387
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:29,460
[Music]

1388
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:31,280
okay some Elias and it'll rank your

1389
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,889
solution on the scoreboard okay and so

1390
01:02:31,889 --> 01:02:34,360
at a certain point you get full credit

1391
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:39,739
and everything after that is for

1392
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:41,960
bragging rights okay that way you know

1393
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,579
that you can stop at a certain point but

1394
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:44,750
if you really want to keep driving

1395
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:46,670
forward and somebody has a faster mallet

1396
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:47,320
than you well you know it's possible you

1397
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:52,429
can drive forward and try to leapfrog

1398
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:54,559
them if you want Labs are submitted via

1399
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:59,630
the auto lab system basically point at

1400
01:02:54,630 --> 01:03:02,969
it and go as of today if you're enrolled

1401
01:02:59,969 --> 01:03:03,130
you have an auto lab account if you

1402
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:05,690
don't if you just enrolled more recently

1403
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:09,550
than we added them at 10:00 a.m. we'll

1404
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:11,599
get you your account tomorrow waitlists
